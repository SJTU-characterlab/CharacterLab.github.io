Abstract:
The movement of human gaze is very important in face to face conversation. Some of the quality of that movement is lost in videoconferencing because the participants look at a single planar image of the remote person. We use an array of cameras to capture a remote user, and then display video of that person on a spherical display. We compare the spherical display to a face to face setting and a planar display. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the camera array and spherical display system in that it allows observers to accurately judge where the remote user is placing their gaze.
